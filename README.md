# Enhanced-Gizmos
A gizmo library that allows you to draw gizmos with more options and also display relevant informations regarding the shapes you draw in Unity.

How to install: Just download the source and put it in your Unity project. I recommend to put it in your "Editor" folder to avoid errors when building your game.
